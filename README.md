ONLINE EXAMINATION SYSTEM is an online test simulator that allows you to take an online exam, test quickly, and avoid wasting time physically verifying the test paper. The major goal of this web-based online assessment system is to completely evaluate students using a fully automated approach that not only saves time but also provides quick and accurate results.
